# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THESE BOUNDARIES
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# START 2005 — a compromise, not a clean line. GLD lists Nov 2004, but DBC and
#   SLV only in 2006 and DBA in 2007, so the commodity class is incomplete for
#   the first two years. Starting later would give a complete universe but lose
#   the run-up to 2008. Ragged entry is the better trade — assets join the
#   universe when they list, as in a real portfolio.
#
# TRAIN 2005-2018 — contains the 2008 financial crisis, so the agent trains on
#   a genuine crash rather than only calm markets. Also spans the 2009-2018
#   bull run, the low-rate era and the 2015-16 correction: enough regime
#   variety that the policy is not fitted to one market state.
#
# VAL 2019-2021 — COVID crash and recovery. Deliberately a different KIND of
#   shock from 2008: faster, policy-driven, sharper reversal. Hyperparameters
#   tuned here are not tuned on a repeat of the training regime.
#
# TEST 2022-2026 — rate hikes, inflation, and the bond-equity correlation
#   breakdown (2022 was rare in that stocks AND bonds fell together, which
#   punishes naive diversification).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WARM-UP
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Indicators need history before they produce a value; the longest window is
# 12-month momentum. Warm-up data feeds indicator computation only — never
# training samples, never evaluation.

WARMUP_DAYS  = 252

# FETCH RANGE — what the collectors request, and what names every raw file
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

FETCH_START = WARMUP_START      # 2004-01-01

LEAKAGE CHECKLIST — verify before reporting any result.

  1. No feature at time t uses data from after t. Applies to every source:
     ALFRED vintages for macro, filing dates for fundamentals, and a
     total-return index compounded forward, never rewritten retroactively.

  2. Scalers and any fitted preprocessing are fit on TRAIN ONLY, then applied
     unchanged to val and test.

  3. The test window is touched once, at the end. If a hyperparameter or
     stopping rule was influenced by test performance, the result is no
     longer out-of-sample.

  4. Warm-up data (2004) computes indicators only — never training samples,
     never evaluation.

  5. Universe membership is fixed across all splits — see UNIVERSE_NOTE in
     tickers.py: survivorship bias inflates all strategies incl. benchmarks.
