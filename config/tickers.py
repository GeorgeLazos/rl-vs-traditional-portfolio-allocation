Asset universe.

Single source of truth for what gets fetched, trained on and allocated across.
Every collector and every downstream stage imports from here.

FOUR CLASSES: equities, bond ETFs, commodity ETFs, REITs.

SOURCE BOUNDARY: Sharadar covers equities and individual REITs only — it sells
no fund data. Funds and the ^VIX index come from yfinance.

    sharadar_tickers()   108  equities + REITs   (Sharadar: prices, fundamentals, actions)
    fund_tickers()        15  ETFs + benchmarks  (yfinance)
    ^VIX                   1  index              (yfinance -> context table, never the panel)

NOTE ON SURVIVORSHIP BIAS: EQUITIES below is the S&P 100 as constituted in 2025.
Using today's membership across all history is a known bias — these are the
firms that survived and got large. See UNIVERSE_NOTE at the bottom.

# Sector tags feed diagnosis, reporting and sector-level features.
#
# THE MAP IS THE CURRENT (2025) GICS APPLIED HISTORICALLY. Two cases carry
# FUTURE information rather than merely a stale label — declare both:
#   * V, MA, PYPL are tagged Financials, effective 2023-03-17. Before that
#     they were Information Technology, so the tag is wrong across all of
#     train, all of val and the first ~14 months of test.
#   * Communication Services did not exist until 2018-09-24. Seven of our
#     eight names (CMCSA, DIS, GOOGL, META, NFLX, T, TMUS, VZ) sat in Consumer
#     Discretionary or Information Technology for essentially all of train.
# ~10 of 98 names are affected — the same class of error as survivorship bias.
# Known remedy if sector ever becomes load-bearing: point-in-time SIC codes
# from EDGAR filings.
#
# Sector membership is THIN at the tails: Materials has exactly one member
# (LIN), Energy and Utilities three each. Peer-relative features must leave
# LIN blank rather than invent a peer group; any model-side sector embedding
# must merge thin sectors into one bucket. The merge rule: sectors below
# SECTOR_MIN_MEMBERS share one "other" bucket, and the result must come to
# exactly SECTOR_BUCKETS — the one-hot width models are trained against.

UNIVERSE_NOTE = """
SURVIVORSHIP BIAS — address this in the dissertation.

EQUITIES is the S&P 100 as of 2025. Applying it to a training window starting
in 2005 means the universe consists entirely of firms that survived and stayed
large — the failures are absent. Returns are therefore biased upward for EVERY
strategy tested, including the benchmarks. Because it inflates the RL agent and
the 1/N and Markowitz benchmarks alike, the comparison stays broadly fair even
though absolute returns are overstated. State it in the Data chapter and
revisit under threats to validity.
